- Min Heap (_vector, binomial, fibonacci_)
- Queue
- Stack 
- Simple List 
- Double List

- Graph

##### Todo 
- B, B*, B+ Trees
- Patricia Tree

##### How to use it , _not recomended before 1.0.0_

- Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lans98/qaedlib
$ cd qaedlib 
$ mkdir /home/USER/.includes
$ cp -r include /home/USER/.includes/qaed
```

- Using it
```cpp
#include <qaed/Graph.hpp> // for example

using namespace qaed; 

// Write code ....

```
- Compiling
```
$ g++ -std=c++17 -I/home/USER/.includes main.cpp source1.cpp source2.cpp
```

_Note: USER refers to your username; main.cpp, source1.cpp, etc are source code examples_

##### Disclaimer:

_This library was created for educational purposes and as a hobby, it lacks on reliability, flexibility,
and many optimization things, it should not be used for production. If you want good
containers you can use STL for C++ and many other good options._

_This library won't be usable until release 1.0.0 (if I reach it)_
